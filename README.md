# ModelFarm + Bun + HTMX
This repl demonstrates an example of a modern web based chat application that communicates with advanced large language models using [Replit's ModelFarm](https://blog.replit.com/modelfarm).

## Core Technology
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/): For serving at lightning speed with minimal footprint
* [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/): Bun's first class http server!
  * This example uses the html, static, and web socket extensions for Elysia
* [HTMX](https://htmx.org/): Because sometimes you just need a light touch of javascript
* [ModelFarm](https://docs.replit.com/ai/model-farm): Replit's configuration and secret-free integration to LLMS
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Because styling stuff shouldn't take a full week
